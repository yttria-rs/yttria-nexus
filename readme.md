# yttria-coding

Yttria sets out to be an end-to-end wireless communications DSP library for developing custom and
novel radio solutions, particularly regarding Software Defined Radios. Yttria-coding is the subcrate
responsible for the codes commonly used in electrical and wireless communications engineering for
their autocorrelation or error correction utility.

The goals of this subcrate are somewhat ambitious, hoping to port much of the functionality present
in the renowned [aff3ct](https://aff3ct.github.io/) library to the rust ecosystem, with a focus on
utility within Yttria, but otherwise still useful.

## Why Yttria?

Yittrium Iron Garnets (YIGs) are a powerful technology that have been around for many years, but are
becoming very powerful and highly relevant in miniaturized SDR applications due to their good filter
characteristics and their extremely high agility. This project hopes to extend that power by making
the software side as powerful and agile as the hardware is becoming.
