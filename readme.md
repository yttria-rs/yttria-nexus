# yttria-system

Yttria sets out to be an end-to-end wireless communications DSP library for developing custom and
novel radio solutions, particularly regarding Software Defined Radios. Yttria-system is the subcrate
responsible for non-radio control or data communication with other components such as virtual
tun/tap devices.

## Why Yttria?

Yittrium Iron Garnets (YIGs) are a powerful technology that have been around for many years, but are
becoming very powerful and highly relevant in miniaturized SDR applications due to their good filter
characteristics and their extremely high agility. This project hopes to extend that power by making
the software side as powerful and agile as the hardware is becoming.
